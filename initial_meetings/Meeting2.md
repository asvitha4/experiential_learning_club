## NOTES
**Topic: Are fashion trends objective or subjective?**                 

- This question occurred because fashion is represented as a “way to express ourselves”

**Tasks to do for Topic**
- Set parameters: age groups (18-24), location, culture, clothing pieces, economic status (celebrities or youtubers)
-	Narrow down to analyzing on one clothing piece: i.e. shoes, sneakers
-	Location would be North America, more specifically USA & Canada (Toronto)

-	Keep away from Bias: who does name brand, who doesn’t?

-	Is fashion in North America as subjective as people think it is?

-	Can you predict the fashion trend in September 2019?

-	Economical difference between Kylie Jenner and a Youtuber 

**Defining words**
-	What is the definition of “basic”?
- It varies between people
- Define fashion 
- Defining the time period / time the trend / era
- Set parameters specifically: 
    - Who are you talking to? Why?


**Thoughts of high school / university students:**
-	"Why am I seeing everyone the exact same clothes?"
- "Where does it come from?"

*Fashion is not as subjective as people say it is*

**More questions:**
- Is fashion actually subjective?
-	Desginers --> Sponsors --> Influencers --> Age Groups/ Universities
-	Is it big corporations running fashion rather individual expression?
-	Looking at the marketing style and/or advertising method of how clothes are being sold or created
       - They should know what the majority of people want 
       -	How do they know this, and how can we find out?
       -	Which corporation should we focus on?
              - i.e. Fashion Nova; everyone is wearing it
