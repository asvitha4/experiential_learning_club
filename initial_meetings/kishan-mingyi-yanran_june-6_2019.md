## Tutoring sessions idea
M: How many students go to the tutoring sessions ?  
Y: It's rare for us to go to office hours   
- Because we go to other places.  
- We feel very comfortable going to Tutor sessions. Because they speak Chinese there, and we feel very comfortable to learn in our native language.  
- - For somethings that really confuses us we feel that we better learn it in Chinese.

## Ming Yi's notes on Optimizing Education idea
Why do I want to know?

Why would students go to tutoring sessions? They already **paid tuition fees**. (Is it worth or not ?)  
- Maybe the professor is not good at teaching.  
- Maybe just lazy. Get a review package instead of studying by themselves.  
- Maybe the language barrier for (international students)  
- Maybe students don't know how to reach the resources in the school. (Aid centre, office hours)
- - Professor side
- - Facility side (TAs, Other staff)
- - Students themselves
